# Time-Series-Classification-LSTM
This project involves classifying astronomical objects using the LSST dataset's time-series data. Various machine learning techniques, including Bidirectional LSTM, were applied. Data preprocessing methods such as Min-Max Normalization and down sampling were used to improve prediction accuracy and optimize model performance.
